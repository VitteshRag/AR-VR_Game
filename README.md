# AR/VR_Game
 
This game was made during an internship at EnGange Technologies, where I interned as an AR/VR instructor to teach College students about VR games and how we can make one in Unity.

The following are some screen shots of the game, where we taught the students level designing as well we Virtual Reality components required to make a VR game in Unity.
